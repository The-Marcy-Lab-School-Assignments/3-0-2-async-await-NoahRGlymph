# Question
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
async/await allows asynchronous code to be written in a style that makes it look synchronous; making it easier to read code.
